# AES-Encrption-Demo
The Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, is the modern gold standard for data encryption.

Here’s a concrete example of what AES encryption ciphertext actually looks like:

## Plaintext message: 
    The acting president was diagnosed with a potentially terminal illness.

## Ciphertext message:
    bWhVOg5IxuiUw1TKrEjFD4CCw9r30KcSp8LU49JXX89i5+K/Z55QeNgPnEoDtK90bbUjpbQZ/yaQGOdXlbZS9/Ntd/mfxnK6GAhyKmtHUUk=

Good luck trying to extrapolate from the ciphertext that the acting president might be dying. You’d need to have an AES secret key to decrypt it.
